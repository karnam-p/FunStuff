# Zephyr Driver Development Presentation

This project contains an interactive HTML presentation that teaches the fundamentals of Zephyr RTOS driver development, SoC/board porting, and the Zephyr build system.

## Features

- **20-slide interactive presentation** covering:
  - Zephyr OS architecture and project structure
  - Device Tree concepts and YAML bindings
  - Kconfig and build system integration
  - Example driver implementations (UART, SPI)
  - Board porting procedure and best practices
  - Testing strategies and validation
  - Animated diagrams for build and boot processes
  - Clickable file tree sidebar with contextual code popups

- **Modern, responsive UI** with keyboard and touch navigation

- **Live code popups**: Click on diagrams or sidebar items to view real Zephyr code snippets

## Usage

Open `zephyr_driver_presentation.html` in your browser. Use the navigation buttons, arrow keys, or swipe gestures to move between slides. Click on build steps, boot steps, or hardware layers to view code examples.

## Structure

- `zephyr_driver_presentation.html` — Main interactive presentation
- `README.md` — This file

## Purpose

This material is designed for embedded developers and students learning how to port Zephyr to new hardware, write drivers, and understand the Zephyr build and initialization process.
